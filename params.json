{"name":"Anr-lightroom-plugin","tagline":"Auto Noise Reduction Plugin for Adobe Lightroom","body":"ANR-Lightroom-Plugin\r\n====================\r\n\r\nAuto Noise Reduction Plugin for Adobe Lightroom\r\n\r\nA plugin for Adobe Lightroom to automatically adjust photo's luminance noise reduction(NR) levels according to the shooting ISO setting and post-processing exposure level.\r\n\r\n* When doing photo post-processing, usually it is necessary to apply different NR levels according to photo's ISO settings to achieve a quality balance between details and noises.  E.g. a picture shot with ISO 3200 may need set luminance NR levcel to 60, while a ISO 400 photo may only need luminance NR level 20. \r\n* Adobe Lightroom is a great and powerful digital photo post-processing software, however it lacks of easy configuration that maps ISO levels to luminance NR levels, so each photo's NR level has to be manually adjusted which make it becomes a boring and time-costing step.\r\n* I wrote this plugin to make photographer's life easier, especially for those using Adobe Lightroom as their primary digital photo processor.\r\n\r\nP.S. There are two types of NR: luminance NR and color NR. This plugin only adjust luminance NR levels as luminance NR usually has much higher impact to the final effect.\r\n\r\nHomepage\r\n---------\r\n* https://github.com/starsy/ANR-Lightroom-Plugin\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---------\r\n1.
